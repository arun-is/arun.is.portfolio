This is the story of how I created the logo for my friend Bernardâ€™s SEO consultancy, Mushi Labs. It was a process full of mistakes and lessons, but at the end, I am happy with the result.

It all started with a tweet from Bernard. After I tweeted about some warmup work I had posted on Dribble, my friend Bernard [tweeted me asking for help](https://twitter.com/bernardjhuang/status/747843104774881281 "Tweet").
